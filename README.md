This repo contains code for algortihm W and algorithm M, along with related datatypes, helper functions, and parser for lambda calculus.

It is based on the excelent [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@adam-jones) and reference [Typescript implementation](https://github.com/domdomegg/hindley-milner-typescript-minimal) by Adam Jones.

## Requirements

The code makes uses of Dart 3.0 features, such as tuples and sealed classes. At the time of writing [Dart 3.0 is currently in beta](https://dart.dev/get-dart#release-channels).
